# When to choose Powerpipe over Grafana Cloud

Grafana Cloud is an open platform for monitoring and visualizing metrics, logs, and traces.

  
Pipes is the preferred alternative for DevOps engineers who use or build dashboards that visualize cloud infrastructure and assess compliance. Works with Steampipe to query infrastructure and Powerpipe to visualize it.
