# FLOWPIPE_WORKSPACE

Sets the Powerpipe [workspace](/docs/reference/config-files/workspace). 

A Powerpipe `workspace` is a "profile" that allows you to define a unified environment that the Powerpipe can interact with.

```bash
export FLOWPIPE_WORKSPACE=my_workspace
```

<!--
FUTURE:

export FLOWPIPE_WORKSPACE=acme/prod
```
